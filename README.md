## Hi there, I'm Sebastian! 👋

I'm a passionate Data Analyst with a huge interest in Data Science. 

Turning raw data into valuable insights and solutions for businesses is what drives me.

In the past I gained expertise in PYTHON, SQL, EXCEL and visualisation tools.

🤝 I'm looking to collaborate on projects involving PYTHON, SQL, EXCEL, and VISUALIZATION with tools like POWER BI or TABLEAU.

👨‍💻 In my free time, I enjoy taking a look at new techniques in our changing data world.

Here on GitHub you'll find a collection of projects that highlight my journey in data analysis. 
Let’s connect and turn data into action!
